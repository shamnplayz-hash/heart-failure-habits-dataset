# heart-failure-habits-dataset
Overview

The Heart Failure Habits Dataset is a synthetic dataset created for practicing healthcare analytics, machine learning modeling, and cardiovascular risk prediction. It contains 1,000 records and 23 features describing demographic variables, lifestyle habits, metabolic indicators, and clinical biomarkers that influence heart failure risk. The dataset includes a binary outcome variable, heart_failure, which simulates whether a patient is diagnosed with heart failure.

This dataset provides a realistic structure similar to clinical data while ensuring complete privacy and ethical use.

Purpose of the Dataset

This dataset was designed for:

Machine learning practice in a healthcare context

Early disease detection modeling

Teaching supervised and unsupervised learning

Feature engineering and exploratory analysis

Developing and evaluating predictive models

Understanding how lifestyle behaviors influence cardiovascular risk

It is ideal for students, researchers, and developers working on prototype models or learning healthcare data workflows.

Synthetic Data Statement

This dataset is fully synthetic and does not contain real patient information.
All values were generated to resemble plausible clinical and lifestyle patterns seen in cardiovascular research. The dataset should not be used for real clinical decision-making or epidemiological conclusions. Its purpose is purely educational and analytical.
